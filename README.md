# LLM Side Projects / Practice / Demo

Contains demo / practice notebooks on language models in 2024 - 2025 jan. Also includes exploratory notebooks on text datasets from Kaggle LLMs Competitions (where I was not a partipant).

Directory Path
- `2024-LLMs`: Demo / practice notebooks on fine-tuning and evaluating language models with programmer's best practices.
- `RLsimulation`: Exists to help me work with language models - repo from the main OpenAI Gym - the old (?) version? (before their expansions I guess) - will reference this one day.
- `wsdm-cup-multilingual-chatbot-arena` and all notebooks at root folder: Contains the dataset from the Multilingual Kaggle Challenge. The goal of the challenge was to predict human preferences across multiple languages using votes from chatbot interactions. Notebooks contain data analytics and various methods attempted to improve multilingual chatbots. Note: the methods I have tried for this activity stems from traditional methods in NLP, and not from recent works / developments (more fun ones). Details on challenge: [Kaggle competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/wsdm-cup-multilingual-chatbot-arena).
